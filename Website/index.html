			<h1>The Future is Here</h1>
			<p>And everybody can be a part of it.<br/><br/>
				The long awaited Android Milkshake, codenamed as Android M is going to release on September 1. This is the most polished version of Android ever. Thanks to all the people who helped us by downloading the developer preview. Bugs in Android are obsolete things. It’s lighter than an OS of such great functionality can be imagined. Due to its lightness, it’s compatible with a lot of devices and helps in increasing battery life. Many features that required third party add-ons have been made default due to popular demand. A very strong integrated anti-virus system ensures your safety. We understand that a longer battery life is very important, and thus, have added features that regulate your battery.  Everything has been connected to the cloud to ensure the protection of your data. A very precise face recognition and thumbprint scanning system ensures your safety without wasting your time in typing your password. Customizability has been our top priority. This version is just like a Milkshake, sweet and tasty, yet light and healthy. And if you want, you can customize it to add whipped cream and a cherry  on top.

			<h1>Everybody?</h1>
			<p>
				Yes, everybody can be a part of it.<br/><br/>
				Not only your mobile phone, watch, television and car, but all devices including your coffee machine, landline telephone, parking machine, are compatible. We have created a special ROM for devices with small single coloured LCD screen. All devices running on JAVA can install the new Android Platform. All the devices running on Android including HTC Dream (first android mobile) can update their version if the company wants to port. There is a separate ROM for the old non android devices (touch and non-touch). This version ensures that your ROM takes very less RAM and battery. While making the Milkshake, we ensured that everybody can drink it.
